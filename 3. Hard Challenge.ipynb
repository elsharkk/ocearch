    "Easy questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. How many total pings are in the Ocearch shark data?\n",
    " 2. How many unique species of sharks are in the data set?\n",
    " 3. What is the name, weight, and species of the heaviest shark(s)?\n",
    " 4. When and where was the very first ping?\n",
    " 5. Excluding results with 0 distance traveled: what's the minimum, average, and maximum travel distances?\n",
    " \n",
    "Intermediate questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Which shark had the most pings?\n",
    " 2. Which shark has been pinging the longest, and how long has that been?\n",
    " 3. Which shark species has the most individual sharks tagged?\n",
    " 4. What is the average length and weight of each shark species?\n",
    " 5. Which shark has the biggest geographic box (largest distance from min lat/lon to max lat/lon, not dist_traveled)?\n",
    " \n",
    "Hard questions:\n",
    " 1. Use folium to plot the first ping, last ping, and a line connecting each ping for the Tiger shark Emma.  Make the first ping marker a 'play' icon, and last ping icon a 'stop' icon.\n",
    " 2. Resample Emma data to have a daily lat/lon average, and interpolate missing results.  Plot a marker for each day, and color them blue for hard data, green for interpolated lat/lons\n",
    " 3. Resample all shark data for daily lat/lon averages, and interpolate missing results\n",
    " 4. Calculate distance between Emma and other sharks on a daily basis\n",
    " 5. Identify the shark that has the shortest average distance to Emma per day (minimum 50 days of pings with Emma)\n",
    " 6. Plot Emma and her closest buddy: interpolated results for each in green, Emma as circle icons and her buddy as square icons"
